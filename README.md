# Android-Studio-project

An application for the Engineering company Prema Tech.
I work at Prema Tech, besides this the company is owned and founded by my father.

The motivation behind it, is besides being my fatherâ€™s company and that I work there. IT could be interesting to develop an application that could help us in the daily work and share the knowledge and information with each other. And show how far we are with the different projects.
Right now every thing is handled in Microsoft programs, so we you are not at the office, you can now know how far the different project are. Which is why this would be a good idea, so that you are able to check from home, where we are with the different work tasks.
