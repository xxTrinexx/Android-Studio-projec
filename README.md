# Android-Studio-project

An application for the Engineering company Prema Tech.
I work at Prema Tech, besides this the company is owned and founded by my father.

The motivation behind it, is besides being my fatherâ€™s company and that I work there. IT could be interesting to develop an application that could help us in the daily work and share the knowledge and information with each other. And show how far we are with the different projects.
Right now every thing is handled in Microsoft programs, so we you are not at the office, you can now know how far the different project are. Which is why this would be a good idea, so that you are able to check from home, where we are with the different work tasks.


MoSCoW:

M -> Must have: Non-negotiable product needs that are mandatory for the team
S -> Should have: Important initiatives that are not vital, but add significant value
C -> Could have: Nice to have initiatives that will have a small impact if left out
W -> Will not have: initiatives that are not a priority for this specific time frame

Before the app:
M -> A to-do list / check list. to manage what to do, and how many packages needs to be send and if a quote is sent, ect.
S -> Be able to delete and add tasks directly in the application
C -> Several lists. So you can sepeate the quotes and packages.
W -> The economic side of the projects (invoices and financial accounting)




the app:
M -> A to-do list / check list was made.
S -> you are able to delete and add tasks directly in the application 
C -> Several lists was not made. But could be added in the future.
W -> The economic side of the projects. Was not made, because of the extend of work it would be, compared to the availeble hours.
